# Diamond State Digital Network (DSDN)

[Arkansas was the first place outside South Africa where diamonds were found at their original volcanic source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_of_Diamonds_State_Park). Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as "The Diamond State".

The DSDN is a network of amateur radio repeater sites connected via RF microwave data links. The sites host repeaters operating on various digital voice modes.

The IP network is comprised primarily of MikroTik hardware for routing and radios and Ubiquiti hardware for switching and PoE.
